Just a script that modifys the android kernel defconfig with the values in a txt file,, just to save time or if you're lazy <br>
NOTE: after checking it works well itll be added to a fork of the kali builder script (just for whos lazy to config every kernel everytime again)<br>
<br>
why did I make it? I just got some free time.
